88.5000  massive success (we already knew that)
90.9000  mild success 
91.7000 biggest success WOW

99.5000 good cancellation, did not see targets
100.7000 great cancellation, no targets of oportunity 
101.3000 great cancellation, no targets available

102.5000 good cancellation, unable to see a known target
103.3000 good cancellation, unable to see known target
104.1000 great cancellation, and success I think ( fell apart later)
